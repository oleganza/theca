Theca is a programming language with strong static typing and dynamic compilation.
Theca is inspired by C, JavaScript and Lua. The goal is to create a simple, efficient and expressive language as an alternative for C.

What Theca is not.

  0. It is not Haskell. It provides mutable variables, easy type casting, pointer arithmetic and other kinds of dirty side-effect features we use C for.
  1. It is not a high-level object-oriented language: objects could be created using closures, structures and types. 
     There could be syntactic addition for polymorphic message sending, but this is not the central part.
     Theca provides powerful structuring features, but they are semi-static. It does not unify structures on byte level,
     does not provide invisible indirections in runtime. But you may generate code with closures, and inspect/create types in runtime.
     Theca should be a great language to build efficient high-level OO languages.
  2. It is not safe over performance language: bound-checking array operations could be implemented with macros and objects.
     By default, you are close to the machine and should know what are you doing.
  3. It is not garbage-collected language: there's no single best GC solution yet and there are many cases when it doesn not matter at all.
  4. It does not provide exceptions (yet). Those could be implemented with coroutines.
  

Etymology 

  A theca (plural thecae) refers to any case, covering, or sheath. 
  The name corresponds to proper incapsulation provided by the language. 


Let's start with examples:

****
Note: Current macro syntax for types will change soon in order to be more "method call" like.
      The reason for this will become clear after I describe how to write macros
****

1. Variables
  
  Variable is declared using alphanumeric characters starting with a lower-case letter (or underscore).
  Variable is always assigned initial value. The type of the variable is set to the type of the initial value.
  
    x = 1
    
  Here we define a variable "x" with initial value 1 of the type Integer.
  
  We may change the variable value, but only to the value of the same type:
  
    x = 2    // fine
    x = 3.14 // compile-time type error
    
  Variable may be defined with a literal or with an expression:

    x = 1
    y = 2
    z = x + y
  
  Type of x, y and (x + y) is determined at compile time and z is defined with type of result of (x + y) which is Integer.
  
  You may force use of UnsignedInteger

    x = UnsignedInteger(0)
    y = UnsignedInteger(1)
    z = x + y

  Then z will be an UnsignedInteger too.
  
  
2. Expressions  
  
  Expressions could be grouped with parentheses and delimited by line breaks or semicolons:
    
    a(); b(); c()
    x = (1; 2)        // x == 2  
    x = ((1 + 2) * 3) // x == 9
  
  Unneccessary line breaks and semicolons are simply ignored:
  
    x = (1; 2; )     // x == 2
    x = (1; 2;;;; )  // x == 2
    
  Each expression returns a value. 
  
  
3. Control flow 
  
  Control flow is implemented with macros. There are some built-in macros, but you may write new macros yourself.
  Note, however, that the built-in macro names are not reserved: you can override any identifier (macro or variable) within some lexical scope.
  
  Conditional logic is implemented with If macro:
  
    If(x > y, True, False)
    
  "If" consists of three parts: predicate, positive branch and negative branch. If the condition is evaluated to True, then positive branch is entered and its code is executed. Otherwise, negative branch is used.
  

4. Functions
  
  You may define a function:

    max = Function(a = Integer(), b = Integer(), 
      If(a > b, a, b)
    )

*. Custom types



*. Default values
  
  In theca, every type has a corresponding default value which is constant.
  Likewise, the type of the value is inspected with the TypeOf(), the default value of the type is 
  
    value = Default
   
  Built-in and already has meaningful default value (like Integer)
  
  
  There is a short version of the "If", with two parts: 

    result = If(x > y, something)
  
  Here, the negative branch is omitted, but its return type is inferred from the positive branch type. 
  Since each type has a default value, the default value is used in the negative branch.
  If the something is of type Integer and x is not greater than y, then the result will be 0 (DefaultValueFor(Integer) == 0)
  
    VariableHoldingInteger = Integer
    VariableHoldingInteger = TypeOf(0)
    DefaultFunctionReturningInteger = Function(a = Integer(), b = Integer(), Integer())
    FunctionReturningInteger = TypeOf(DefaultFunctionReturningInteger)
    DefaultFunctionReturningInteger == DefaultValueFor(FunctionReturningInteger)
  
  
*. Type casting
  
  Types can be casted using the type name:
  
    signedInteger = 1
    unsignedInteger = UnsignedInteger(signedInteger)
  
  
  
*. Pointers
  
  Theca supports pointers and pointer arithmetic. The pointer type is always bound to some value type:
  
    age = 23
    pAge = AddressOf(age)
    TypeOf(pAge) == PointerTo(Integer)
    
  Default pointer value for any value type is Nil:
  
    nil = PointerTo(Integer)() // here PointerTo(Integer) is a type and empty parentheses depict taking a default value for this type
    TypeOf(nil) == PointerTo(Void)
    nil == Nil
  
  Pointer types are casted as any other types:
  
    result = functionReturningPointerToVoid()
    resultAsPointerToInteger = PointerTo(Integer)(result) // result is reinterpreted as a pointer to Integer
  
  
*. Void pointer and Void type

  Each expression returns a value. However, some expressions do not return any meaningful value. For such cases there's a void pointer:
  
    PointerTo(Void)

*. Memory management



*. Object-Oriented Programming
